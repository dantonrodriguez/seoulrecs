## be prepared to not use google maps
Google maps is only marginally better than useless in Korea. As of early 2017, Foursquare and then tripadvisor were the best English language crowd-sourced review resources. Despite this, I have included links to places on google maps.

Naver maps and Daum maps are what the locals use and are good. Naver maps effectively require you to read Korean. Daum, you can generally get by with only reading English as the interaction design is reasonable.

## coffee

coffee in korea is generally expensive and mediocre, but there are many exceptions. A fun place to go is Coffee Project. You can do a blind taste test on coffee from around the world

## food

Korean food is pretty seasonal. 

### samgyetang 삼계탕
 Whole chicken stuffed with herbs, rice, and a whole lotta love cooked in a thick ginsengy reduced soup. Most places serving this will be solid. The following place is reliably good:

### jjim dak 찜닭
Chicken, noodles, potatoes, and fire. My second favorite dish in Korea. Unless you are comfortable eating raw serrano chiles or something similar, do not get the maximum heat version.

### maeun galbi jjim 매운 갈비찜
Sweet, spicy pork ribs. One of the single best dishes in Korea, my personal favorite. I've been told my favorite spot shut down. This place has it. Get the dry rib version, not the stew. While still edible and not quite as hot as the max heat jjim dak, I'd advise against the max heat level.

### yang gochi 양꼬치
Cumin and chile covered lamb skewers. Recommended beverage: so-maek which is 3 parts beer to 1 part soju. This place is near a lake that is quite scenic during the spring and fall.

### Guangjang shijang 광장시장
A famous street food market in northern seoul.
https://goo.gl/maps/2YhxQwku2cJPmYT49
The market has a few specialties: 육회 pronounced yook-hway is raw beef with korean pear, raw egg, sesame oil, and some other spices. It can be an outstanding and very underrated dish.

The dish the market is most well known for is 빈대떡 pronounced pin-day-dohk

### Jok Pal
This is slow cooked pork knuckle meat. The places that do this well are ridiculously good. This place does it well.
