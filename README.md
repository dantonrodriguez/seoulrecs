## be prepared to not use google maps
Google maps is only marginally better than useless in Korea. As of early 2017, Foursquare and then tripadvisor were the best English language crowd-sourced review resources. Despite this, I have included links to places on google maps.

Naver maps and Daum maps are what the locals use and amazing. As long as you can read Korean.      

## coffee

coffee in korea is generally expensive and mediocre, but there are certainly gems to be found. If you're a coffee snob, Paul Bassett is the most reliable common coffee chain around.

A fun place to go is Coffee Project. You can do a blind taste test on coffee from around the world

## food

Korean food is pretty seasonal. Given that it's summer, I'll include some summer recommendations and just some generally awesome stuff.

### samgyetang 삼계탕
이열치열! Fight fire with fire. Whole chicken stuffed with herbs, rice, and a whole lotta love cooked in a thick ginsengy reduced soup. Most places serving this will be solid. The following place is good if find yourself nearby:

### jjim dak 찜닭
Chicken, noodles, potatoes, and fire. My second favorite dish in Korea. Unless you are comfortable eating raw serrano chiles or something similar, do not get the maximum heat version. Look for the bird hugging the chile pepper.

### maeun galbi jjim 매운 갈비찜
Sweet, spicy pork ribs. One of the single best dishes in Korea, my personal favorite. I've been told my favorite spot shut down. This place has it. I would recommend the dry rib version, not the stew. While not quite as hot as the max heat jjim dak, I'd advise against the max heat level.

### yang gochi 양꼬치
Cumin and chile covered lamb skewers. Recommended beverage: so-maek which is 3 parts beer to 1 part soju. This place is near a lake that is quite scenic during the spring and fall.
